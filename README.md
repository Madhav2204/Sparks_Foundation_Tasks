Their Vision Statement : A world of enabled and connected little minds, building future. Our Mission Statement To inspire students, help them innovate and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind.



# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w
You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
Use R or Python or perform this task.
Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j 

# Task-3 : To Explore Business Analytics (Level - Beginner)

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)
Dataset link :https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl
Create storyboards. Screen record along with your audio explaining the charts and interpretations.


# Task-4 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’
As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.
What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
Data can be found at https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5
You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)

# Task-5 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’
As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.
Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.
You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)

# Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

# Task-7 : Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis (Level - Advanced)

Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
Stock to analyze and predict SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com
Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6
Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model.
